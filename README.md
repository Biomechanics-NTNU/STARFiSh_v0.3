STARFiSh
========
 
is a scientific simulation program for blood flow in mamals!

STARFiSh_v0.3 is released in July 2014. It is the follow up version of vascular1DFlow_v0.2 
 
 
 
STARFiSh_v0.3 includes:

    - vascular network creator (vnc):
      program to set-up of arterial network.xml descriptions
    
    - the STARFiSh deterministic flow solver:
      core simulation program which calculates the arterial flow and pressure waves 
      in arterial networks based on the conservation equation for mass and momentum
    
    - 2D and 3D visualisation tools:
      post processing and visualisation of the simulation results
